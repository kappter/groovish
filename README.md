# 🎶 CollabJams - Real-Time Musical Collaboration App

**CollabJams** is a platform for musicians and vocalists to collaborate remotely by responding to a base track with their own recordings. Each session is guided by musical constraints like key, mode, mood, and tempo, and allows real-time creative interaction.
